# Peculiar Produce
As part of the 2024 BFX Game Jam, our team "Peculiar Produce" has created a small demo of a game we call 'Deserted Duo'. Deserted Duo is a local multiplayer platformer that transforms and uses your inputs as blocks, allowing players to drop and pick up specialised blocks in order to perform certain tasks.
